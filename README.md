Ansel's dotfiles
================

My personal, opinionated dotfiles that I use on all my linux machines

WARNING
-------

The install script provided with these dotfiles is destructive and will overwrite files without asking. To ensure that you do not lose anything important please read [install.sh](https://github.com/anstosa/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh) so you know which files will be overwritten and make backups accordingly.

The install script will also install various programs without asking. Please read [install.sh](https://github.com/anstosa/dotfiles/blob/master/install.sh) to make sure you want all of these programs before continuing

I cannot be held responsible if you lose any important data.

Installation
------------

1. Clone repo: `git clone git@github.com:anstosa/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles`
4. **[OPTIONAL]** Backup existing dotfiles
5. Install dotfiles: `~/.dotfiles/install.sh`
6. **[RECOMMENDED]** Restart or `source ~/.bashrc` in all open terminals
